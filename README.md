Not an actual OS, but it tries to be...

My NixOS flake. While I wouldn't generally recommend anyone else tries to use this (it's heavily tailored to my needs!), they might provide interesting ideas or inspiration.

Features <ul>
<li>Custom Utilities: A handful of scripts I've written for specific tasks, like rebuilding NixOS or home-manager or taking screenshots.</li>
</ul>

Important Notes  <ul>
<li>Designed for Me: This is entirely tailored to my devices and practices; you won't be able to use this at all.
    Use at Your Own Risk: No guarantees about stability or usability for anyone else.</li>
</ul>
