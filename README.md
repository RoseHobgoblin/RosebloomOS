Not an actual OS, but it tries to be...

My NixOS flake. While I wouldn't generally recommend anyone else tries to use this, it might provide interesting ideas or inspiration. This repository is mainly for me to sync my flake across devices. 

Features <ul>
<li>Custom Utilities: A handful of my personal utilities for specific tasks, like rebuilding NixOS/home-manager or taking screenshots.</li>
</ul>

Important Notes  <ul>
<li>Designed for Me: This is entirely tailored to my devices and practices; you won't be able to use this at all.</li>
<li>Use at Your Own Risk: If you do decide to use this, there are zero guarantees about stability or usability.</li>
</ul>
