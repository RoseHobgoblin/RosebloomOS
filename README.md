My NixOS flake. While I wouldn't generally recommend anyone else tries to use this, it might provide interesting ideas or inspiration. This repository is mainly for me to sync my configuration across devices. 

This is entirely tailored to my devices and practices; you won't be able to use this at all. You won't be able to log in.If you REALLY want to use this, clone this and edit everything referencing my username and hostname. I would highly recommend you just study this and copy portions of the code you want, rather than trying to use this.
